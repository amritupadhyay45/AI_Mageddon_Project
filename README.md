## Key Features


- **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to detect known and unknown threats.
- **NSL-KDD Dataset**: Utilizes the comprehensive NSL-KDD dataset for training and evaluation
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects multiple types of network attacks
- **High Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art detection rates and low false positive rates
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed on small and large networks.

## Dataset Information

The NSL-KDD dataset is a refined version of the KDD'99 dataset, addressing many of the original dataset's limitations:
